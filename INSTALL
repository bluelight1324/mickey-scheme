To install Mickey Scheme, you need a C++ compiler, dlopen et al. and
readline as well as autotools, if you're building from the github sources.

To build:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst # change prefix to your liking
    $ make -j install

You should then be able to run Mickey from `pwd`/inst/bin/mickey.
